## Guidelines for contributing a new analyzer or suppressor

File an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/issues/new) describing your proposed rule prior to working on a pull request. This will ensure that the rule gets triaged and there is no duplicate work involved from an existing rule or another contributor working on a similar rule.

## Pull Requests

We love to get pull requests. If you have a bug fix to offer or a new analyzer/suppressor (see guidelines above), please send us a pull request.
Prior to submitting a pull request, ensure the build and all tests pass.
Every new feature or bug fix should be accompanied by unit tests to cover your change and proper documentation.
