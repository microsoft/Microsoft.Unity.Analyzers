## Bug reports

If you have a bug report, please file an issue. 
If you can send a pull request with a repro of the bug in the form of a unit test, please do submit that PR
and link to it from the Issue you file.

## Guidelines for contributing a new analyzer or suppressor

File an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) describing your proposed rule prior to working on a pull request. This will ensure that the rule gets triaged and there is no duplicate work involved from an existing rule or another contributor working on a similar rule.

## Pull Requests

We love to get pull requests. If you have a bug fix to offer or a new analyzer/suppressor (see guidelines above), please send us a pull request.
Prior to submitting a pull request, ensure the build and all tests pass.
Every new feature or bug fix should be accompanied by unit tests to cover your change and proper documentation.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
