    # So far we only need managed assemblies for testing
    # We don't need to download/install Unity every run, we just need to cache those managed assemblies
    # But we have to deal with the following:
    # - the cache only works under the GITHUB_WORKSPACE folder (so we cannot cache C:\Program Files\Unity)
    # - the cache is linited to 400M per run (so we cannot cache the full Unity installation)
    # - When Unity is not installed, our detection logic will fallback to C:\Program Files\Unity given we miss registry keys
