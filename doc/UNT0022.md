# UNT0022 Inefficient method to set position and rotation 

Accessing the transform should be done as few times as possible for performance reasons. When a users sets the position and rotation, they should use SetPositionAndRotation().

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
        transform.rotation = transform.rotation;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix assignment:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        transform.SetPositionAndRotation(new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f), transform.rotation);
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
