# UNT0001 Empty Unity message

Unity messages are called by the runtime even if they're empty. Remove them to avoid unnecessary processing.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void FixedUpdate()
    {
    }

    private void Foo()
    {
    }
}
```

## Solution

Remove empty Unity message:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{

    private void Foo()
    {
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
