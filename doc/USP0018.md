# USP0018 Unity objects should not be used with throw expressions

`UnityEngine.Object` should not be used with `throw` expressions.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0016 - Use throw expression

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public MonoBehaviour value;
    public void Method(MonoBehaviour value) {
        if (value == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));

        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, this code can be simplified to `this.value = value ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value))`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity has overridden the `==` operator for `UnityEngine.Object`. If you use `??` operator with those objects, it will not behave as expected because it checks for null in a different way.
