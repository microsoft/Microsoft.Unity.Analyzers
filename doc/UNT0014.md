# UNT0014 GetComponent called with non-Component or non-Interface Type

`GetComponent`, `TryGetComponent`, `GetComponents`, `GetComponentInChildren`, `GetComponentsInChildren`, `GetComponentInParent`, and `GetComponentsInParent` should be called only with Types that extend `UnityEngine.Component`, or Types that are an Interface

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    private int i;

    private void Start()
    {
        i = GetComponent<int>();
    }
}
```

## Solution

Make sure the type argument passed to any `GetComponent` method extends `UnityEngine.Component`, or is an Interface Type.
