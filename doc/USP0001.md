# USP0001 Unity no null coalescing

Unity `GameObject`s should not be used with the null coalescing operator.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0029 - Null check can be simplified

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform a;
	public Transform b;

	public Transform NC()
	{
		return a != null ? a : b;
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, `return a != null ? a : b` can be simplified to `return a ?? b`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity has overridden the == operator for `GameObject`s. If you use the == operator to compare an `GameObject` to null, it will return true if the `GameObject` is destroyed, but not actually null. The ?? operator cannot be overridden in this way, and therefore behaves inconsistently with the == operator, because it checks for null in a different way.
