# USP0021 Prefer reference equality

We have a dedicated diagnostic `UNT0029` to prevent is-null check with `UnityEngine.Object`. But `IDE0041` will suggest to use is-null check over reference equality method.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0041 - Use 'is null' check

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{

    public void Update()
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(transform, null))
            return;
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, `ReferenceEquals(arg, null)` can be simplified to `arg is null`. But doing that with `UnityEngine.Object` will trigger `UNT0029`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

We suppress `IDE0041` for that very specific case, because instead you'll have no options for achieving the desired behaviour without suppressing a warning.
