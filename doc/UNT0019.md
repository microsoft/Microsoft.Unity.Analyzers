# UNT0019 Unnecessary indirection call for GameObject.gameObject and Transform.transform

Unity `GameObject` has a property `gameObject` that returns `this` and same for
`Transform.` This allows calls like `GameObject.gameObject.gameObject` or
`Transform.transform` to occurs which is redundant and hinders performance.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

``` csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
     private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)
	{
        	GameObject original = null;
		GameObject duplicate = original.gameObject;
	}
}
```

## Solution

Fix expression:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
     private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)
	{
        	GameObject original = null;
		GameObject duplicate = original;
	}
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
