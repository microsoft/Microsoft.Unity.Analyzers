# UNT0019 Unnecessary indirection call for GameObject.gameObject

Unity `GameObject` has a property `gameObject` that returns `this`. This allows calls like `GameObject.gameObject.gameObject` to occur which is redundant and hinders performance.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

``` csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)
    {
        GameObject original = null;
        GameObject duplicate = original.gameObject;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix expression:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider collider)
    {
        GameObject original = null;
        GameObject duplicate = original;
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
