# USP0009 Don't flag methods with the ContextMenu attribute as unused

Methods decorated with the `ContextMenu` attribute are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	[ContextMenu("Context Menu Name")]
	private void ContextMenuMethod()
	{
		// Some code
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot detect any calls to `ContextMenuMethod` in the class.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

`ContextMenuMethod` is called indirectly by Unity, which is undetectable by the IDE.
