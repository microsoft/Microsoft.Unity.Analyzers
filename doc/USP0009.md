# USP0009 Don't flag methods with the ContextMenu attribute or referenced by a field with the ContextMenuItem attribute as unused

Methods decorated with the `ContextMenu` attribute, or referenced by a field with `ContextMenuItem` are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ContextMenu("Context Menu Name")]
    private void ContextMenuMethod()
    {
        // Some code
    }
}
```
and:
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ContextMenuItem(""Reset Health"", ""ResetHealth"")]
    public int health;

    private void ResetHealth()
    {
        health = 100;
    }
}
```
## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot detect any calls to `ContextMenuMethod` nor `ResetHealth` in those classes.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

`ContextMenuMethod` and `ResetHealth` are called indirectly by Unity, which is undetectable by the IDE.
