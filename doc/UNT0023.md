# UNT0023 Coalescing assignment on Unity objects

Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects, which is incompatible with coalescing assignment.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform a = null;
    public Transform b = null;

    public Transform NP()
    {
        return a ??= b;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Use null comparison:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform a = null;
    public Transform b = null;

    public Transform NP()
    {
        return a = a != null ? a : b;
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
