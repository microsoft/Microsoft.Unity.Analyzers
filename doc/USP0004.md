# USP0004 Don't set fields with SerializeField or SerializeReference attributes to read-only

Fields with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes should not be marked read-only.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0044 - Make field readonly

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField]
	private string someField = "default";
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that the field is ever assigned outside of the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to mark the field as read-only.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

A field with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes are exposed and can be assigned in the Unity Inspector. Making the field read-only would break this behavior.
