# USP0023 The Unity runtime invokes Unity messages

Don't flag incorrect naming styles for Unity messages.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE1006 - Naming rule violation.

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic

using the following `.editorconfig` file (forcing private methods to use camel-case):
```ini
dotnet_naming_style.camel_case.capitalization = camel_case
dotnet_naming_symbols.private_methods.applicable_kinds = method
dotnet_naming_symbols.private_methods.applicable_accessibilities = private
dotnet_naming_rule.private_methods.symbols = private_methods
dotnet_naming_rule.private_methods.style = camel_case
dotnet_naming_rule.private_methods.severity = warning
```

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision c)
	{
		// OnCollisionEnter should not be flagged for naming violation
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The Code Style analyzer detects a private method using Pascal-case instead of camel-case, and under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to flag this usage given the `.editorconfig` instructions.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

The Code Style analyzer doesn't realize this is a Unity message, and therefore has no way of determining that it needs to have a specific case to function correctly.
