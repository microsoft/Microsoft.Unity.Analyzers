# UNT0031 Asset operations in LoadAttribute methods

Asset operations such as asset loading should be avoided in methods decorated with `InitializeOnLoadMethod` or `DidReloadScripts` or static constructors in types decorated with `InitializeOnLoad`. Those methods are called before asset importing is completed and therefore the asset loading can fail resulting in a null object.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEditor;

class Loader
{
    [InitializeOnLoadMethod]
    public void Foo() {
        AssetDatabase.LoadAllAssetsAtPath(""foo"");
    }
}
```

## Solution

To do initialization after a domain reload which requires asset operations use the `[AssetPostprocessor.OnPostProcessAllAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetPostprocessor.OnPostProcessAllAssets.html)` callback. This callback supports all asset operations and has a parameter signaling if there was a domain reload.
