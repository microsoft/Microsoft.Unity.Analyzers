# UNT0039 Use `RequireComponent` attribute when self-invoking `GetComponent`

The `RequireComponent` attribute automatically adds required components as dependencies.

When you add a script which uses `RequireComponent` to a `GameObject`, the required component is automatically added to the `GameObject`. This is useful to avoid setup errors. For example a script might require that a `Rigidbody` is always added to the same `GameObject`. When you use `RequireComponent`, this is done automatically, so you are unlikely to get the setup wrong.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        var rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        ...
    }
}
```

## Solution

Use `RequiredComponent` attribute:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody))]
public class PlayerScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        var rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        ...
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
