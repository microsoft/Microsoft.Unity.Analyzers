# UNT0017 SetPixels invocation is slow

Unity is using two distinct representations for a RGBA Color:
* [Color](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html): Each color component is a **floating point value** with a range from 0 to 1. (this format is used inside all graphics cards and shaders). 
* [Color32](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color32.html): Each color component is a **byte value** with a range from 0 to 255. (32bit RGBA).

`Color32` is much faster and uses 4X less memory. `Color` and `Color32` can be implicitly converted to each other.

Compared to `SetPixels`, `SetPixels32` is much faster and uses less memory.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Renderer rend = GetComponent<Renderer>();
        Texture2D texture = Instantiate(rend.material.mainTexture) as Texture2D;
        rend.material.mainTexture = texture;

        // ...

        Color[] colors = new Color[3];
        colors[0] = Color.red;
        colors[1] = Color.green;
        colors[2] = Color.blue;
        texture.SetPixels(colors);

        // ...

    }
}
```

## Solution

If 32bit-RGBA is compatible with your scenario, use `SetPixels32` instead.

Note: sometimes though 32bit-RGBA is not enough (like for HDR, Dolby Vision or advanced color manipulation).

No automatic code fix is available for this diagnostic.
