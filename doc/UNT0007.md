# UNT0007 Null coalescing on Unity objects

Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects, which is incompatible with null coalescing.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform a;
	public Transform b;

	public Transform NC()
	{
		return a ?? b;
	}
}
```

## Solution

Use null comparison:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform a;
	public Transform b;

	public Transform NC()
	{
		return a != null ? a : b;
	}
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
