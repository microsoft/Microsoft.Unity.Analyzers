# USP0019 Don't flag private methods decorated with PreserveAttribute or UsedImplicitlyAttribute as unused

Methods decorated with `PreserveAttribute` or `UsedImplicitlyAttribute` attributes are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEgine.Scripting;

class Loader
{
    [PreserveAttribute]
    private void InvokeMe()
    {
    }

    public string Name; // "InvokeMe" serialized
    private void Update() {
        Invoke(Name, 0);
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot find any references to the method `InvokeMe` and believes it to be unused.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Even though the IDE cannot find any references to `InvokeMe` , it will be called by Unity, and should not be removed.
