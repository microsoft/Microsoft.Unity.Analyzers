# UNT0028 Use non-allocating physics APIs

Non-allocating versions of Physics query APIs have been introduced. You can replace `RaycastAll` calls with `RaycastNonAlloc`, `SphereCastAll` calls with `SphereCastNonAlloc`, and so on.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update() {
        var result = Physics.RaycastAll(Vector3.zero, Vector3.zero);
        // ...
        result = Physics.RaycastAll(Vector3.zero, Vector3.zero);
    }
}
```

## Solution

Instead of allocating a new array for each call, you can reuse a pre-allocated array to store the results. This will improve performance, especially for frequent calls.

No automatic code fix is available for this diagnostic.
