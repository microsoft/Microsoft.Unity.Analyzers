# USP0020 The Unity runtime invokes Unity messages

Unity messages should not be flagged as unused because Unity invokes those messages.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0052 - Private method can be removed as it is never invoked.

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	void Start()
	{
		//Some code
	}

	/// <summary>
	/// This reference triggers IDE0052 <see cref=""Start"" />
	/// </summary>
	public float speed = 0f;
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot find any references to the method `Start` and believes it to be unused.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Even though the IDE cannot find any references to `Start`, it will be called by Unity, and should not be removed.
