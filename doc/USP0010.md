# USP0010 Don't flag fields with the ContextMenuItem attribute as unused

Fields decorated with the `ContextMenuItem` attribute are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ContextMenuItem("Foo", "Bar")]
    private string contextMenuString = "";
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot detect any references to `contextMenuString` in the class.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

`contextMenuString` is used indirectly by Unity, which is undetectable by the IDE.
