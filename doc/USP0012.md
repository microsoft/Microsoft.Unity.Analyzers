# USP0012 Don't flag private methods decorated with InitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute, RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute or DidReloadScripts as unused

Methods decorated with `InitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute` or `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute` attributes are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

class Loader
{
    [InitializeOnLoadMethod]
    private static void OnProjectLoadedInEditor()
    {
    }

    [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]
    private static void OnSceneLoadedAndGameRunning()
    {
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot find any references to the methods `OnProjectLoadedInEditor` and `OnSceneLoadedAndGameRunning`, and believes them to be unused.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Even though the IDE cannot find any references to `OnProjectLoadedInEditor` and `OnSceneLoadedAndGameRunning`, they will be called by Unity, and should not be removed.
