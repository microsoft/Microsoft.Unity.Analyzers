# UNT0003 Usage of non generic GetComponent

Usage of the generic form of GetComponent is preferred for type safety.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	private Rigidbody rb;

    private void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent(typeof(Rigidbody)) as Rigidbody;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Use the generic form of GetComponent:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	private Rigidbody rb;

    private void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
