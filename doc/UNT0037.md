# UNT0036 Inefficient method to get localPosition and localRotation 

Accessing the `Transform/TransformAccess` should be done as few times as possible for performance reasons. Instead of reading `localPosition` and `localRotation` sequentially, you should use `GetLocalPositionAndRotation()` method.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        var localPosition = transform.localPosition;
        var localRotation = transform.localRotation;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix assignment:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        transform.GetLocalPositionAndRotation(out var localPosition, out var localRotation);
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
