# USP0003 The Unity runtime invokes Unity messages

Unity messages should not be flagged as unused because Unity invokes those messages.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	void Start()
	{
		//Some code
	}

	void Update()
	{
		//Some code
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot find any references to the methods `Start` and `Update`, and believes them to be unused.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Even though the IDE cannot find any references to `Start` and `Update`, they will be called by Unity, and should not be removed.
