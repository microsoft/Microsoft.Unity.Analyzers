# UNT0029 Pattern matching with null on Unity objects

Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects, which is incompatible with pattern matching with null.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform a = null;

    public void Update()
    {
        if (a is not null) { }
    }
}
```

## Solution

Use null comparison:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform a = null;

    public void Update()
    {
        if (a != null) { }
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
