# UNT0032 Inefficient method to set localPosition and localRotation 

Accessing the `Transform/TransformAccess` should be done as few times as possible for performance reasons. Starting with Unity 2021.3.11f1, instead of setting `localPosition` and `localRotation` sequentially, you should use `SetLocalPositionAndRotation()` method.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        transform.localPosition = new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
        transform.localRotation = transform.localRotation;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix assignment:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        transform.SetLocalPositionAndRotation(new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f), transform.localRotation);
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
