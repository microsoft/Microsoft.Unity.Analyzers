# USP0002 Unity objects should not use null propagation

`UnityEngine.Object` should not be used with null propagation.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0031 - Null check can be simplified

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform NP()
	{
		return transform != null ? transform : null;
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, `return transform != null ? transform : null` can be simplified to `return transform?.transform`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity has overridden the `==` operator for `UnityEngine.Object`. If you use the `==` operator to compare a `UnityEngine.Object` to null, it will return true if the `UnityEngine.Object` is destroyed, even if the object itself isn't actually null. Null propagation cannot be overridden in this way, and therefore behaves inconsistently with the == operator, because it checks for null in a different way.
