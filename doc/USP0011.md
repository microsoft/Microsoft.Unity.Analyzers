# USP0011 Don't make fields with the ContextMenuItem attribute read-only

Fields decorated with the `ContextMenuItem` attribute should not be made read-only.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0044 - Make field readonly

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ContextMenuItem("Foo", "Bar")]
    private string contextMenuString = "";
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that `contextMenuString` is ever assigned outside of the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to mark the field as read-only.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

A field with the `ContextMenuItem` attribute is used indirectly by Unity. Making the field read-only would prevent it from being changed by Unity.
