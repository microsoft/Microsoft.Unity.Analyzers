# UNT0038 Cache `WaitForSeconds` invocations

Creating `WaitForSeconds` (or similar) instances increases memory usage. Caching them reduces garbage collection overhead and boosts performance.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    IEnumerator Coroutine()
    {
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);
    }
}
```

## Solution

Cache invocation:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    private static WaitForSeconds _waitForSeconds1 = new WaitForSeconds(1f);

    IEnumerator Coroutine()
    {
        yield return _waitForSeconds1;
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
