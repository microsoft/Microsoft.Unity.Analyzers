# USP0016 Initialization detection with nullable reference types

`C# 8.0` introduces `nullable reference types` and `non-nullable reference types`. Initialization detection needs to take Unity initialization methods into account.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

CS8618 - Non-nullable field is uninitialized. Consider declaring the field as nullable.

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
#nullable enable

using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	private GameObject field;
	
	private void Start()
	{
		Initialize();
	}
	
	private void Initialize()
	{
		field = new GameObject();
	}
}
```
and:
```csharp
#nullable enable

using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	public GameObject Property { get; set; }
	
	private void Awake()
	{
		Property = GameObject.Find("Player");
	}
}
```
and:
```csharp
#nullable enable

using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	[SerializeField] private UnityEngine.Object serializedField;
}
```
## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The Code Style analyzer cannot detect that specific members are initialized by the Unity runtime.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Fields or properties can be assigned to in Unity's initialization methods such as `OnEnable()`, `Awake()`, and `Start()` or all methods called by these, or the inspector.
