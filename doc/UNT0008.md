# UNT0008 Null propagation on Unity objects

Unity overrides the null comparison operator for Unity objects, which is incompatible with null propagation.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform NP()
	{
		return transform?.transform;
	}
}
```

## Solution

Use null comparison:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	public Transform NP()
	{
		return transform != null ? transform : null;
	}
}
```
