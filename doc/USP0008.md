# USP0008 Don't flag private methods used with Invoke/InvokeRepeating or StartCoroutine/StopCoroutine as unused

Private methods used with `Invoke`, `InvokeRepeating`, `StartCoroutine` or `StopCoroutine` are not unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	void Start()
	{
		Invoke("InvokeMe", 10.0f);
	}

	private void InvokeMe()
	{
		// Invoke me
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot detect any calls to `InvokeMe` in the class.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

`InvokeMe` is called indirectly by Unity, which is undetectable by the IDE.
