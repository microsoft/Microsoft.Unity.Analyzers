# USP0017 Unity objects should not use coalescing assignment

`UnityEngine.Object` should not be used with the coalescing assignment operator.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0074 - Use compound assignment

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform a;
    public Transform b;

    public Transform NC()
    {
        // Please note that this construct should not be used with Unity objects either, and will trigger a diagnostic.
        // We are just using it here for demonstration purposes.
        return a ?? (a = b);
    }
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

Under normal circumstances, `return a ?? (a = b)` can be simplified to `return a ??= b`.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

Unity has overridden the `==` operator for `UnityEngine.Object`. If you use the `??=` operator with those objects, it will not behave as expected because it checks for null in a different way.
