# UNT0024 Give priority to scalar calculations over vector calculations

When working in tight loops or performance-critical sections, remember that scalar math is faster than vector math.

Therefore, whenever commutative or associative arithmetic allows, attempt to minimize the cost of individual mathematical operations.

You can see [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BestPracticeUnderstandingPerformanceInUnity7.html), the related documentation on the Unity website.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Compute()
    {
		Vector3 x;
		float a, b;
		
		Vector3 slow = a * x * b;
    }
}
```

## Solution

Re-order operands for better performance:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Compute()
    {
		Vector3 x;
		float a, b;
		
		Vector3 fast = a * b * x;
    }
}
```

A code fix is offered for this diagnostic to automatically apply this change.
