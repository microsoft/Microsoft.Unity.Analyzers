# USP0006 Don't flag private fields with SerializeField or SerializeReference attributes as unused

Private fields with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes should not be marked as unused.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0051 - Remove unused private members

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField]
	private string someField = "default";
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that the field is ever used within the project. Therefore, under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to remove the unused code.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

A field with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes are exposed and can be used in the Unity Inspector.
