# USP0007 Don't flag fields with SerializeField or SerializeReference attributes as never assigned

Fields with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes should not be marked as unassigned.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

CS0649 - Field is never assigned to, and will always be null

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField]
	private string someField;
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The compiler detected an uninitialized private field declaration that is never assigned a value.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

A field with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes are exposed to Unity and can be assigned in the Unity Inspector.
