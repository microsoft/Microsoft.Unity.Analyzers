# USP0013 Don't flag private fields with SerializeField or SerializeReference attributes as unused

Private fields with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes should not be marked as unused by FxCop.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

CA1823 - Remove unused fields

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	[SerializeField]
	private string someField = "default";
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

FxCop does not detect that the field is ever used within the project. Therefore, under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to remove the unused code.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

A field with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes are exposed and can be used in the Unity Inspector.
