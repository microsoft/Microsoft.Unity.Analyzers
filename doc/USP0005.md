# USP0005 The Unity runtime invokes Unity messages

Fields with the `SerializeField` or `SerializeReference` attributes should not be marked read-only.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

IDE0060 - Remove unused parameters

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

class Camera : MonoBehaviour
{
	OnCollisionEnter(Collision c)
	{
		// do stuff, but c remains unused
	}
}
```

## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE does not detect that you've used `c`, and under normal circumstances, it would be reasonable to remove the unused parameter.

## Why do we suppress this diagnostic?

The IDE doesn't realize this is a Unity message, and therefore has no way of determining that it needs to have a specific signature to function correctly.
