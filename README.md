# Analyzers for Unity ![](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project is intended to provide to Visual Studio a better understanding of Unity projects by adding new Unity-specific diagnostics or by removing general C# diagnostics that do not apply to Unity projects. 

Check out our [exhaustive list of analyzers and suppressors](doc/index.md) defined in this project.

If you have an idea for a rule that would constitute a best practice for Unity developers to follow, please open an issue with the description.
