# Analyzers for Unity

[![Build status](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers)

This project provides Visual Studio with a better understanding of Unity projects by adding Unity-specific diagnostics or by removing general C# diagnostics that do not apply to Unity projects.

Check out the [list of analyzers and suppressors](doc/index.md) defined in this project.

# Releases

For Visual Studio these analyzers **ship in the box** (_Game development with Unity_ workload). For Visual Studio Code, please use our official Unity extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc).

We also ship them on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers) as for people building class librairies for Unity and for other advanced usages.

# Suggesting a new Analyzer

If you have an idea for a best practice for Unity developers to follow, please open an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) with the description.

# Prerequisites

For building and testing, you'll need **.NET 9 (SDK 9.0.201+) and Visual Studio 2022 17.13+, or Visual Studio Code 1.92+**.

We are using `slnx` solution files, so when using Visual Studio, please make sure to enable `Solution File Persistence Model` in `Tools/Options/Preview Features`.

This project binaries are targeting **Visual Studio 2019 16.4+** and **Visual Studio Code 1.76+**.

This project is using the `DiagnosticSuppressor` API to conditionally suppress reported compiler/analyzer diagnostics.

On Windows, you'll need the _Visual Studio extension development_ workload installed to build a VSIX to use and debug the project in Visual Studio.

For unit-testing, we require Unity to be installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version for that.

# Building and testing

Compiling the solution:
`dotnet build .\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.slnx`

Running the unit tests:
`dotnet test .\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.slnx`

You can open `.\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.slnx` in your favorite IDE to work on the analyzers and run/debug the tests.

# Debugging the analyzers on a Unity project

Running and debugging the tests is the easiest way to get started but sometimes you want to work on a real-life Unity project.

## On Visual Studio

- Open the `Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.Vsix.slnx` solution.
- Make sure `Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.Vsix` is set as the startup project.
- Hit play (Current Instance) to start debugging an experimental instance of Visual Studio 2022.
- Load any Unity project in the Visual Studio experimental instance then put breakpoints in the `Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers` project.

# Handling duplicate diagnostics 

Starting with **Visual Studio Tools for Unity 4.3.2.0**, we ship and automatically include this set of analyzers/suppressors in all projects generated by Unity (using `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive).

The downside of this is when trying to debug your own solution is to find yourself with duplicated diagnostics because Visual Studio will load both:
- the project-local analyzer that we release and include automatically, through the `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive. 
- the VSIX extension you deployed, that will apply analyzers/suppressors to all projects in the IDE.

To disable the project-local analyzer, and keeping a workflow compatible with Unity re-generating project files on all asset changes, you can add the following script in an `Editor` folder of your Unity project to disable all local analyzers loaded with `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive.

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class DisableLocalAnalyzersPostProcessor : AssetPostprocessor
{
	public static string OnGeneratedCSProject(string path, string content)
	{
		return Regex.Replace(content, "(\\<Analyzer)\\s+(Include=\".*Microsoft\\.Unity\\.Analyzers\\.dll\")", "$1 Condition=\"false\" $2");
	}
}
```

# Creating a new analyzer 

To easily create a new analyzer, you can use the following command:

`dotnet run --project .\src\new-analyzer`

This will automatically create source files for the analyzer, associated tests and add resource entries. If your new analyzer's name contains the word `suppressor`, the tool will create a new suppressor. By default the tool will create a regular analyzer and codefix.

Example for creating `CustomAnalyzer`, `CustomCodeFix` and `CustomTests` classes :

`dotnet run --project .\src\new-analyzer Custom`

Example for creating `CustomSuppressor` and `CustomSuppressorTests` classes :

`dotnet run --project .\src\new-analyzer CustomSuppressor`
