# Analyzers for Unity ![](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This project is intended to provide to Visual Studio a better understanding of Unity projects by adding new Unity-specific diagnostics or by removing general C# diagnostics that do not apply to Unity projects. 

Check out the [list of analyzers and suppressors](doc/index.md) defined in this project.

If you have an idea for a best practice for Unity developers to follow, please open an issue with the description.

# Prerequisites
For building and testing, you'll need the .NET Core SDK. We recommend using the **.NET Core SDK Version 3.1.100 (LTS)** or later.

This project is using the `DiagnosticSuppressor` API to conditionally suppress reported compiler/analyzer diagnostics. This API is available starting with **Visual Studio 2019 16.3** or **Visual Studio for Mac 8.3**. On Windows, you'll need the _Visual Studio extension development_ workload installed to build a VSIX to use and debug the project in Visual Studio.

For unit-testing, we require Unity to be installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version for that.

# Building and testing

Everything can be compiled and deployed using the command line:

Compiling the main project only:
`dotnet build .\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers`

Unit-Testing:
`dotnet test .\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.Tests`

Compiling all projects and deploying analyzers/suppressors as a VSIX extension into the Visual Studio Experimental Instance:
`msbuild .\src\Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.sln`

# Debugging

The easiest way to compile and debug interactively is to use Visual Studio 2019 :
- Load the `Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.sln` solution.
- Set `Microsoft.Unity.Analyzers.Vsix` as your startup project.
- Hit play (Current Instance) to start debugging an experimental instance of Visual Studio 2019.
- Load any Unity project in the VS experimental instance then put breakpoints in the Analyzer project using the VS main instance.

# Handling duplicate diagnostics 

Starting with **Visual Studio Tools for Unity 4.3.2.0 (or 2.3.2.0 on MacOS)**, we ship and automatically include this set of analyzers/suppressors in all projects generated by Unity (using `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive).

The downside of this is when trying to debug your own solution is to find yourself with duplicated diagnostics because Visual Studio will load both:
- the project-local analyzer that we release and include automatically, through the `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive. 
- the VSIX extension you deployed, that will apply analyzers/suppressors to all projects in the IDE.

To disable the project-local analyzer, and keeping a workflow compatible with Unity re-generating project files on all asset changes, you can add the following script in an `Editor` folder of your Unity project to disable all local analyzers loaded with `<Analyzer Include="..." />` directive.

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public class DisableLocalAnalyzersPostProcessor : AssetPostprocessor
{
	public static string OnGeneratedCSProject(string path, string content)
	{
		return Regex.Replace(content, "(\\<Analyzer)\\s+(Include=\".*Microsoft\\.Unity\\.Analyzers\\.dll\")", "$1 Condition=\"false\" $2");
	}
}
```

# Create a new analyzer 

To easily create a new analyzer, you can use the following command:

`dotnet run --project .\src\new-analyzer`

This will automatically create source files for the analyzer, associated tests and add resource entries.
